# Portfolio

## Description

- My motivation for this website came from building my own portfolio for others to view.
- I built this website for future employers to learn about me and the work I have done.
- Throughout the creation of this webpage I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, how to add hover selecters to my navigation as well as decoration. I also learned how to make my website responsive for different broswers/users.
